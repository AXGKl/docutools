# Installation

This repo is intended as a dev dependency of other repos which want mkdocs
compatible documentation.

1. Configure the package server in your build framework (e.g. poetry like
   [this](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/)).
2. Add `docutools = "^<version>"` as a dev dependency.

See the general [installation guidelines](http://github.pages.com/lc-devapp/) for DevApps based packages and
