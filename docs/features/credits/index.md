- Creates CREDITS.md based on a poetry lock file, i.e. currently requires poetry as a build system
- Example: This repo's [Credits Page](../../about/credits.md).
- Heavily based on [Timothée Mazzucotelli](https://github.com/pawamoy)'s work.



Reminder: Includes work like:

```bash
~/repos/docutools❯ cat docs/about/credits.md
{ !CREDITS.md!} # w/o the space between `{` and `!`.
```
