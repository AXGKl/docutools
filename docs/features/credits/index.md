# Credits :lnksrc:fn:src/lcdoc/mkdocs/credits/__init__.py,t:

Usage: :lnksrc:fn:src/lcdoc/assets/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml,m:lcd-credits,t:m

- Creates CREDITS.md based on a poetry lock file, i.e. currently requires poetry as a build system
- Heavily based on the work of ["pawamoy"](https://github.com/pawamoy).
- Example: This repo's [Credits Page](../../about/credits.md).


Reminder: Markdown full page includes work like:

```bash
~/repos/docutools‚ùØ cat docs/about/credits.md
{ !CREDITS.md!} # w/o the space between `{` and `!`.
```
