## [Documentation](https://axgkl.github.io/docutools/) building tools

This repo is providing a set of plugins for [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) compatible documentation.

It is meant to be used as a development dependency for projects.

Most notable feature: **[Literate Programming](./features/lp/)**.

> Most plugins should work in other mkdocs variants as well. No guarantees though.

Note: Some features are not yet documented.
