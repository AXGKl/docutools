## [Documentation](https://axgkl.github.io/docutools/) building tools

This repo is providing a set of plugins for [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) compatible documentation.

Means: It is meant to be used as a development dependency for projects.


Most plugins should work in other mkdocs variants as well. No guarantees though.

Notes:

- "Work in Progress" The termcast feature is heavily W.I.P!
- Many feats not yet documented
